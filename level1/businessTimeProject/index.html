            <p class="paragraph1">Halfway down the trail to hell, in a shady meadow green, are the souls of all dead troopers camped near a good ol' time canteen, and this eternal resting place is known as Fiddler's Green.</p>
            <p class="paragraph2">Marching passed, straight through to hell, the Infantry are seen, accompanied by the Engineers, Artillery, and Marines. For none but the shades of Cavalry men dismount at Fiddler's Green.</p>
            <p class="paragraph3">Though some go marching down the trail to seek a warmer scene, no trooper ever gets to hell 'ere he's emptied his canteen, and so rides back to drink again with friends at Fiddler's Green.</p>
            <p class="paragraph4">And so when man and horse go down beneath the saber keen, or in a roaring charge of fierce melee, you stop a bullet clean, and the hostiles come to get your scalp, just empty your canteen, and put your pistol to your head, and go to Fiddler's Green.</p>
            <p class="battlecry">Ai-ee-YAH!!</p>
